# Gotypist [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pb-/gotypist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pb-/gotypist)

A simple touch-typing tutor that follows [Steve Yegge's methodology](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html) of going in fast, slow, and medium cycles.

The TL;DR of this methodology is that you make three passes for each phrase.

 * **Fast** - type as fast as you can without any attention to proper technique or correctness
 * **Slow** - use proper technique at all costs, go as slow as needed to achieve that
 * **Normal** - type at *target speed*, try to make no mistakes

Gotypist will score each pass accordingly: errors do not matter in the first pass, speed does not matter in the second pass, and both matter in the final pass. Check out `score.go` for details (which are subject to change).

This project is mainly motivated by trying out [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go), but it is definitely ready for productive learning.
